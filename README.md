# Intro

This is a simple chat app running on [Syncano](http://www.syncano.com).

It uses [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController/) framework and [syncano-ios](https://github.com/Syncano/syncano-ios) library.

To see how the app works, you don't need to register anywhere - please feel fry to use the API keys available in the source code.

If you you'd like to play with your own data, you can create your own Syncano account [here](https://login.syncano.com/sign_up). Once you have it, just replace instance name, API Keys and project/collection IDs with your own.

I'm in a process of writing a blog post about the app - I'll link it here as soon as it's ready.

If you have any questions - contact me at [support@syncano.com](mailto:support@syncano.com).
