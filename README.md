# Intro

This is a simple chat app running on [Syncano](http://www.syncano.com).

It uses [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController/) framework and [syncano-ios](https://github.com/Syncano/syncano-ios) library.

To see how the app works, you don't need to register anywhere - please feel fry to use the API keys available in the source code.

If you you'd like to play with your own data, you can create your own Syncano account [here](https://login.syncano.com/sign_up). Once you have it, just replace instance name, API Keys and project/collection IDs with your own.

Blog post about this version of the app can be found [here](https://www.syncano.io/ios-chat-app-jsqmessagesviewcontroller/).

Last updated was done on Oct 10 2015, when I updated code to Swift 2.0 and fixed a bug.

This version of the app runs on Syncano beta and won't be supported and fixed anymore, instead new version working on stable version of Syncano will be creted.
