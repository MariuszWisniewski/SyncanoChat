# Intro

This is a simple chat app running on [Syncano](http://www.syncano.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ios-chat-app).

It uses [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController/) framework and [syncano-ios](https://github.com/Syncano/syncano-ios) library.

To see how the app works, you don't need to register anywhere - please feel fry to use the API keys available in the source code.

Unfortunately, it's no longer possible to create new account on Syncano Beta. You can get an account on new version of our platform here: [https://dashboard.syncano.io](http://dashboard.syncano.io/#/signup/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ios-chat-app).

Blog post about this version of the app can be found [on our blog](https://www.syncano.io/ios-chat-app-jsqmessagesviewcontroller/).

Last updated was done on Oct 10 2015, when I updated code to Swift 2.0.

This version of the app runs on Syncano beta and won't be supported and fixed anymore, instead please find new version here: https://github.com/lifcio/SyncanoChat
