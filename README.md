# Intro

This is a simple chat app running on [Syncano](http://www.syncano.com).

It uses [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController/) and [syncano-ios](https://github.com/Syncano/syncano-ios) library.

You don't need to register anywhere to try how it works - please feel fry to use API keys available in the source code.

If you like it and you would like to play with your own data, you can create your own Syncano account [here](https://login.syncano.com/sign_up).

I'm in a process of writing a blog post about the app - I'll link it here as soon as it's ready!.
