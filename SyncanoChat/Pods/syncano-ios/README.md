# Syncano iOS Library

## Overview
---

Syncano's iOS library is written in Objective-C and provides communication with Syncano ([www.syncano.com](http://www.syncano.com/)) via HTTPS RESTful interface and TCP sockets.

The full source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Syncano/syncano-ios) - feel free to browse or contribute.

## Build Library
-------------

We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for external libraries dependencies and their installation. You have to install CocoaPods plugin and use it to install external libraries Syncano's iOS Library depends on. 
 
To install CocoaPods on your Mac type: 

```shell
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

To install libraries used by `syncano-ios` execute this command in the same directory as the 'Podfile' file:

```shell
$ pod install
```

To compile the library, make sure to use `syncano-ios.xcworkspace` (not `.xcodeproj`).

## Downloading
---

You can download archived sources of the latest version of Syncano’s iOS Library by right clicking on following link and choosing “Save As…”:

[syncano-ios archive on GitHub](https://github.com/Syncano/syncano-ios/archive/master.zip)

Our library depends on following third party frameworks, so you will need to download them as well:

[CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket)
 
[AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)

[Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle)

If you want to use CocoaPods, add this to your Podfile:

```shell
pod ‘syncano-ios’, ‘~>3.1.2’
```
	
## Installing
---

Unzip previously downloaded files, drag the `.xcodeproject` files to your project/workspace, and add their targets as your app dependency.

If you use CocoaPods, after adding our library to your Podfile, type the following into your terminal:

```shell
$ pod install
```

## Modification
------------

To add external library dependencies, edit 'Podfile' in your main directory and type:

```shell
pod 'library name' 
```

To remove an external library, remove the line with this library in 'Podfile', save it, and execute this command:

```shell
$ pod install
```

Documentation and further information on CocoaPods is available at: http://cocoapods.org/

## Documentation
-------------

 Appledoc documentation can be generated by building a `Documentation` target in `syncano-ios.xcworkspace`. Docs will be in the `Syncano-Docs` directory and will be installed to the Xcode documentation, too. In case something is wrong, logs are put into the `appledoc.log` file. If you need to download `appledoc` visit [https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/).

To write documentation, we recommend using the [`VVDocumenter` XCode plugin](https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode). It makes writing correctly structured documentation a little easier. Simply place your cursor above method/class/anything you wish to describe, and type `///` to generate a documentation template snippet for that item.

## Getting started
---

### Import Syncano header

```objective-c
/// Used for REST connection
#import <Syncano/Syncano.h>
```

### Create main Syncano object 
(This will be used to send requests to your instance of Syncano.):

```objective-c
Syncano *syncano = [Syncano syncanoForDomain:@“YOUR-SYNCANO-DOMAIN” apiKey:@“YOUR-API-KEY-123456”];
```

### Send data to Syncano 
(Use a project ID and collection ID from your admin GUI, i.e. YourDomain.syncano.com, for the below. You can use the “default” values or create your own.):

```objective-c
NSString *textToSend = @“Some sample text”;
UIImage *imageToSend = [UIImage imageNamed:@“sampleImage.png”];

SyncanoParameters_DataObjects_New *params = [[SyncanoParameters_DataObjects_New alloc] initWithProjectId:@“PROJECT_ID” collectionId:@“COLLECTION_ID” state:@"pending"];
params.text = textToSend;
params.image = imageToSend;

///For an asynchronous connection, enter the below and work with the returned response
[syncano dataNew:params callback:^(SyncanoResponse_DataObjects_New *response) {
	if (response.isResponseOK) {
	}
}
```

### Download data from Syncano:

```objective-c
///Describe what you want to download by using parameters
SyncanoParameters_DataObjects_Get *params = [[SyncanoParameters_DataObjects_Get alloc] initWithProjectId:@“PROJECT_ID” collectionId:@“COLLECTION_ID”];
params.dataId = @“123456”; // set if you want to download one particular object. Leave empty if you want to download all objects from that collection

///For an asynchronous connection, enter the below and work with the returned response
	[syncano dataGet:params callback:^(SyncanoResponse_DataObjects_Get *response) {
	if (response.isResponseOK) {
		SyncanoData *data = response.data;
	}
}
```

We also offer synchronous connections if you’d like to manage threading yourself. You can use the exact same methods to connect with Syncano using TCP socket - just use SyncanoSyncServer class object instead of Syncano class.
